## Universal Two-Path Import System (Refined)
- [ ] Every content type (SCORM, HTML, quiz) gets the same two-path choice at import
- [ ] Path A - Native: serve content exactly as-uploaded inside sandboxed iframe, no shell wrapping
- [ ] Path B - LMS Shell: re-host content inside branded internal LMS presentation shell
- [ ] LMS Shell features: branded header, sidebar chapter/slide nav, progress bar, completion badge, prev/next controls, notes panel, bookmarking

- [ ] Correct answers identified by * prefix on answer text (e.g. "*True", "*Alternative 1")
- [ ] Matching questions use pipe delimiter: "Premise|Response"
- [ ] Export quiz to XLS matching exact Template sheet column layout
- [ ] Export includes both a "Template" sheet (reference) and a "Questions" sheet with the quiz data
- [ ] Import endpoint: POST /api/quiz/import — accepts XLS/XLSX, returns parsed question list for preview before saving
- [ ] Import preview UI: show parsed questions in a table, allow user to confirm or discard
- [ ] Export button on quiz builder page downloads XLS in template format
- [ ] Validation: flag unsupported question types, missing question text, no correct answer marked
- [ ] Upload sample template file to S3 and provide download link from quiz builder

## Bug Fix: Upload Requires Organization Selection
- [x] Auto-create a default "Personal Workspace" org for site owner on first login
- [x] Add backend procedure to ensure user always has at least one org
- [x] UploadPage: auto-select org when user only has one org (skip the selector)
- [x] UploadPage: if no org exists, auto-provision one before showing upload form
- [x] Fix org selector to not block upload for site owner

## Bug Fix: Player iframe shows Teachific app + 404 on content files
- [ ] Diagnose upload route: check how files are stored (S3 keys, extracted paths)
- [ ] Fix static file serving for extracted SCORM content
- [ ] Fix PlayerPage iframe src to point to correct content entry point
- [ ] Verify SCORM manifest parsing sets correct entryPoint field
- [ ] Test full upload → play flow end-to-end

## Bug Fix: Player iframe + Share Links
- [x] Fix iframe src — currently loads Teachific app shell instead of SCORM content
- [x] Add /api/content/:packageId/* proxy route to serve extracted S3 files with correct MIME types
- [x] Create bare /embed/:packageId route (no admin nav) for share/embed links
- [x] Fix share links to point to /embed/:packageId
- [x] Test full upload → play → share flow

## Logo Branding
- [x] Upload Teachific.png logo to CDN
- [x] Apply logo to sidebar header (replaces icon + text)
- [x] Apply logo to login screen (white/inverted version)
- [x] Apply logo to embed player LMS shell header
- [x] Set logo as browser tab favicon in index.html

## Dynamic URL Parameters

- [x] Same text lockup on login screen
- [x] Same text lockup in embed player header
- [x] Collapsed sidebar shows just teal "t" icon character

## Bug Fix: Upload Spinning / Timeout
- [x] Diagnose upload timeout root cause (body size limit, multer, S3)
- [x] Fix server body size limit and multer config for large ZIPs — switched to diskStorage
- [x] Add streaming S3 upload with real-time progress events (XHR + SSE)
- [x] UploadPage: show file size before upload starts
- [x] UploadPage: real-time bytes-uploaded progress bar with % and MB/MB display
- [x] UploadPage: phase labels (Upload → Extract → CDN Upload → Ready)
- [x] Batch-streaming extraction: read CONCURRENCY files at a time to avoid RAM exhaustion
- [x] Seed AdvancedCardiacSonographer.zip (345 files) under All About Ultrasound org (ID 1)

## Bug Fix: Learner URL Parameters Not Stored in Sessions
- [ ] Audit EmbedPage: confirm URL params are parsed and passed to sessions.start mutation
- [ ] Audit sessions.start procedure: confirm all learner fields are accepted and written to DB
- [ ] Check PlayerPage (non-embed): does it also parse and forward URL params?
- [ ] Verify play_sessions rows contain learner fields after a tracked play
- [ ] Fix whichever layer is dropping the params
- [ ] Test end-to-end with a constructed tracking URL

## File Organization: Folders & Subfolders
- [ ] Add content_folders table (id, name, parentId, orgId, ownerId, createdAt, updatedAt)
- [ ] Add folderId column to content_packages table
- [ ] Generate and apply migration SQL
- [ ] Add folder CRUD tRPC procedures (create, rename, delete, list, move)

## URL Builder Redesign: Template Placeholder Mode
- [x] Replace manual-entry fields with a template placeholder system
- [x] Each param shows its placeholder token (e.g. {{learner_name}}) for use in the host site
- [x] Generate a base embed URL with all enabled params as placeholders
- [x] Provide tabbed code snippets: Plain JS, iframe HTML, and a generic LMS/server-side example
- [x] JS snippet uses string replacement to swap placeholders with the host site's dynamic variables
- [x] Explain that the host site is responsible for substituting values before launching the iframe
- [x] Add a "Live Preview" section where user can test-fill values and see the final URL

## Mobile Responsiveness
- [ ] DashboardLayout: collapsible sidebar drawer with hamburger menu on mobile
- [ ] FilesPage: show type/status/plays on mobile, folder sidebar as collapsible panel
- [ ] FileDetailPage: tabs scroll horizontally, form fields full width, sharing section stacks
- [ ] AnalyticsPage: stats cards wrap, table scrolls horizontally
- [ ] UploadPage: full width on mobile
- [ ] PlayerPage/EmbedPage: iframe fills full viewport on mobile
- [ ] Dashboard/Home: stat cards wrap to 2-col grid on mobile
- [ ] Navigation: hamburger opens full-screen nav drawer on mobile

## Bug Fix: Iframe Embed Broken on External Sites
- [ ] Proxy content bytes through server instead of redirecting to S3 (avoids S3 X-Frame-Options blocks)
- [ ] Add X-Frame-Options: ALLOWALL and correct CORS headers to content proxy responses
- [ ] Ensure embed page itself has no frame-blocking headers
- [ ] Test embed loads on boutultrasound.com mobile

## Bug Fix: Embed Requires Login (Critical)
- [ ] Make sessions.start a publicProcedure (no auth required)
- [ ] Make sessions.end a publicProcedure
- [ ] Make packages.get a publicProcedure for embed context
- [ ] Update EmbedPage: remove login redirect, allow anonymous session start
- [ ] Content proxy routes already public (Express, no tRPC auth)
- [ ] Test: incognito window can view embedded content

## Access Control: Public / Private Per Package
- [x] Add isPublic boolean column to content_packages (default false = private)
- [x] packages.get: make publicProcedure, return package only if public OR user is authenticated org member
- [x] sessions.start: block unauthenticated start for private packages
- [x] sessions.end / scorm data: already publicProcedure
- [x] FileDetailPage Details tab: Public/Private toggle with live save and badge in header
- [x] EmbedPage: if package is private and user not logged in, show login wall
- [ ] PlayerPage: same private access gate (low priority — admin-only route)
- [ ] Share link: token-protected links bypass the public/private check

## Bug Fix: Embed Content Flash
- [x] Content shows briefly then disappears in embed player
- [x] Root cause: permissions.get was protectedProcedure — threw UNAUTHORIZED for unauthenticated users, causing tRPC retries and re-renders that flashed the iframe
- [x] Fix: made permissions.get a publicProcedure; added retry:false + staleTime:Infinity to pkg and perms queries in EmbedPage

## File Organization: Drag-and-Drop Folders
- [ ] Install @dnd-kit/core and @dnd-kit/sortable for drag-and-drop
- [ ] Two-column layout: folder tree sidebar (left) + package grid (right)
- [ ] Drag package cards onto folder nodes to move them
- [ ] Folder drop zones highlight on hover during drag
- [ ] Clicking a folder filters packages to show only that folder's contents
- [ ] Breadcrumb path shows current folder location
- [ ] "All Files" and "Uncategorized" virtual folders in sidebar

## Bug Fix: Drag-to-Order Questions Not Working on Mobile in Iframe
- [x] Diagnose: iframe sandbox attribute blocking touch/pointer events
- [x] Removed sandbox attribute from all iframes in EmbedPage and PlayerPage (native + LMS shell modes)
- [x] Applies to ordering, connect, and match question types — all rely on touch drag events

## UI: Teal Fullscreen Button on Mobile
- [x] EmbedPage: fullscreen button teal-highlighted on mobile screens
- [x] PlayerPage: fullscreen button teal-highlighted on mobile screens (both native and LMS shell modes)

## UI: Mobile Fullscreen Prompt Banner
- [x] EmbedPage: show themed banner on mobile with "Best displayed in full screen" + Full Screen + Dismiss (✕)
- [x] PlayerPage: same banner in both native and LMS shell modes
- [x] Banner only shows on mobile (sm breakpoint), hidden when fullscreen is active, dismissed via state

## Feature: Upload New Version (Version Replacement)
- [x] Version upload endpoint: POST /api/upload/version/:packageId — same extraction logic, increments version number
- [x] Keep same package ID / embed URL — only the content files change
- [x] FileDetailPage Versions tab: Upload New Version card with file picker, changelog field, and progress bar
- [x] Version history list showing versionLabel, changelog, file count, entry point, and Current badge
- [ ] Allow rolling back to a previous version from the version history list (future)

## Feature: Drag-and-Drop Folder Organization
- [x] Add sortOrder column to content_folders table
- [x] Add folders.reorder tRPC procedure to persist folder order
- [x] packages.move procedure already existed in routers.ts
- [x] FilesPage: draggable package cards that can be dropped onto folder nodes
- [x] FilesPage: reorderable folder list in sidebar via drag handle
- [x] FilesPage: fix stale @/contexts/AuthContext import

## Bug Fix: Folder Sort Order Not Persisting
- [x] Fix getFoldersByOrg in db.ts to sort by sortOrder ASC (was sorting alphabetically by name)
- [x] Folder drag-and-drop reorder now persists correctly across page refreshes

## Feature: Auto-Fullscreen on Mobile
- [x] Add autoFullscreenMobile boolean column to content_packages table (default false)
- [x] Generate and apply migration SQL
- [x] Expose autoFullscreenMobile in packages.get (public) and packages.update (protected) tRPC procedures
- [x] Add toggle in FileDetailPage Details tab under Mobile Playback section
- [x] EmbedPage: read autoFullscreenMobile from package, detect mobile UA, request fullscreen on mount
- [x] PlayerPage: same auto-fullscreen logic for admin preview
- [x] Dismiss mobile prompt banner automatically when auto-fullscreen fires
- [x] Write vitest test for packages.update with autoFullscreenMobile field

## Bug Fix: Folder Sidebar — Remove Uncategorized Virtual Folder
- [x] Remove "Uncategorized" virtual folder entry from the sidebar
- [x] "All Files" remains the only top-level filter (shows all packages regardless of folder)
- [x] Clicking a real folder filters to only that folder's packages
- [x] Packages without a folderId appear under "All Files" and inside whichever folder is selected (or all)
- [x] Remove "drop-uncategorized" drop target; dragging a package off a folder just moves it back to no folder via the folder's own drop zone or context menu
- [x] Update empty-state message when a folder is selected but empty

## Bug Fix: New Version Not Showing on Mobile
- [x] Audit content proxy: was querying ALL assets for a package, ignoring versionId — old entry point matched first
- [x] Fix contentRoutes to filter file_assets by currentVersionId in both /entry and /* routes
- [x] Add Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate + Pragma: no-cache to all proxy responses
- [x] Remove forwarding of S3 ETag/Cache-Control headers that caused mobile caching
- [x] Add ?v={currentVersionId} cache-buster to iframe src in EmbedPage and PlayerPage

## Bug Fix: Version Uploader Timeout on Large Files
- [x] Audit: root cause was streamToBuffer() loading entire ZIP into RAM before S3 upload, blocking the HTTP response
- [x] Replace streamToBuffer() with storagePutStream() in both /package and /version routes — streams file directly to S3 without RAM buffer
- [x] Remove unused streamToBuffer helper and createReadStream import
- [x] Rewrite UploadNewVersion component to use XHR with upload.onprogress for real byte-level progress
- [x] Two-phase progress: Phase 1 = XHR byte upload % (0-100%), Phase 2 = SSE extraction/CDN progress
- [x] XHR timeout set to 0 (unlimited) — server handles the 10-min timeout
- [x] phaseLabel updated to show "Uploading... 47%" during upload phase

## Bug Fix: Upload Silently Stops (Proxy Body Limit)
- [x] Root cause: reverse proxy silently drops requests exceeding its body size limit with no error
- [x] New chunkedUploadRoutes.ts: initiate / chunk / finalize endpoints at /api/chunked
- [x] Each chunk is 5 MB max — well under any proxy limit
- [x] Finalize assembles chunks into a temp file, then forwards to /api/upload/version/:id internally
- [x] All SSE extraction progress reused unchanged
- [x] UploadNewVersion UI: 3-step chunked flow with per-chunk XHR progress (shows "Uploading... 47%")
- [x] Installed form-data package for server-side multipart forwarding
- [x] Mounted /api/chunked router in server/_core/index.ts

## Bug Fix: Upload Still Timing Out After Chunked Upload
- [x] Root cause: finalize was forwarding the 457 MB assembled file via internal HTTP POST — same proxy limit
- [x] Fix: export processZipVersion + emitProgress from scormUploadRoutes
- [x] Fix: chunkedUploadRoutes finalize now calls processZipVersion directly — no HTTP forward at all
- [x] Fix: storagePutStream rewritten to use form-data + Node http.request piping — truly streams to S3 without loading file into RAM
- [x] Finalize responds immediately after storagePutStream + updatePackage; extraction runs in background
- [x] SSE progress stream unchanged — client still receives extraction updates via /api/upload/progress/:id

## Bug Fix: Chunk Upload Stops at ~40%
- [x] Diagnosis: proxy idle timeout drops connection when sequential chunks leave gaps > ~60s
- [x] Reduced chunk size from 5 MB to 2 MB so each chunk completes faster
- [x] Changed from sequential to parallel batch upload (3 chunks at a time) to keep connection active
- [x] Added per-chunk retry with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) up to 3 retries
- [x] Per-chunk XHR timeout set to 2 minutes (was unlimited)
- [x] Accurate overall progress using per-chunk byte tracking across parallel uploads

## Feature: Restrict Large Uploads (>100 MB) to Site Owner Only
- [x] Server: /initiate rejects with 403 if totalBytes > 100 MB and user.openId !== OWNER_OPEN_ID
- [x] Frontend: passes totalBytes in initiate body; 403 error surfaces as toast with clear message
- [x] Chunk size reduced to 512 KB to pass through strict production proxy limits
- [x] Parallel batch size increased to 4 chunks at a time

## Feature: Version Restore + Auto-Delete + Upload Size Warning
- [ ] Add replacedAt timestamp column to content_package_versions table
- [ ] Generate and apply migration SQL
- [ ] DB helper: setVersionReplacedAt(versionId, timestamp)
- [ ] DB helper: getVersionsDueForDeletion(packageId) — versions where replacedAt < now - 30 days
- [ ] DB helper: deleteVersionAssets(versionId) — remove S3 files and DB rows
- [ ] tRPC procedure: packages.versions.restore — sets package currentVersionId, clears replacedAt on restored version, sets replacedAt on previously current version
- [ ] tRPC procedure: packages.versions.purgeExpired — deletes S3 assets + DB rows for versions past 30-day window (called on page load)
- [x] FileDetailPage Versions tab: "Restore" button on non-current versions
- [x] FileDetailPage Versions tab: "Auto-delete in Xd" amber badge + "Pending deletion" badge on replaced versions
- [ ] FileDetailPage Versions tab: confirmation dialog before restore (deferred)
- [x] Frontend: show "File size is restricted to 100 MB." inline warning when selected file exceeds 100 MB
- [x] Upload button disabled for oversized files for non-privileged users

## Feature: Split Admin Role into Site Admin + Org Admin
- [x] Schema: users.role enum updated to ["site_owner","site_admin","org_admin","user"]
- [x] Schema: org_members.role enum updated to include org_admin
- [x] Migrated existing admin users to site_admin
- [x] Applied migration SQL
- [x] Server: adminProcedure now allows site_owner + site_admin
- [x] Server: upload size gate — site_owner + site_admin = unlimited; org_admin + user = 100 MB cap
- [ ] Server: orgAdminProcedure scoped to their org (deferred)
- [ ] Server: packages/files queries for org_admin scoped to their assigned org only (deferred)
- [x] Frontend: role labels updated in Users admin panel (Site Admin, Org Admin, Owner, User)
- [x] Frontend: sidebar admin nav hidden from org_admin users
- [ ] Frontend: org_admin My Files shows only their org's packages (deferred)

## Feature: Org Admin Content Scoping
- [x] packages.list: filtered to org_admin's assigned org (getOrgIdForUser)
- [x] analytics.summary: scoped to org_admin's org
- [x] analytics.byPackage: 403 if package is outside org_admin's org
- [x] sessions.listByPackage: 403 if package is outside org_admin's org
- [x] folders.list: scoped to org_admin's assigned org
- [x] Helper getOrgIdForUser(userId) added to db.ts
- [x] No frontend changes needed — all queries return scoped data automatically

## Bug Fix: Upload Fails Mid-Way (Presigned S3 Multipart)
- [ ] Server: createMultipartUpload tRPC mutation — returns uploadId + array of presigned PUT URLs (one per 5 MB part)
- [ ] Server: completeMultipartUpload tRPC mutation — receives ETags from client, tells S3 to assemble, triggers ZIP processing
- [ ] Server: abortMultipartUpload tRPC mutation — cleanup on client cancel/error
- [ ] Client: UploadNewVersion uploads each part directly to S3 presigned URL (no proxy involved)
- [ ] Client: accurate per-part XHR progress (0-100%)
- [ ] Client: after all parts uploaded, calls completeMultipartUpload, then polls SSE for extraction progress
- [ ] Apply same flow to initial package upload (UploadPage)

## Bug Fix: Upload Permanently Broken — Direct-to-Storage Approach
- [ ] Investigate Forge API for presigned upload endpoint
- [ ] Test direct browser-to-S3 upload bypassing proxy entirely
- [ ] Implement chosen approach end-to-end
- [ ] Update UploadNewVersion UI for new flow
